    // Start with 3, and keep multiplying by 3 until less than 10,000
    for (var power = 3; power < 10000; power *= 3) { 
      console.log(power); // ðŸ”¸ Breakpoint 1: Inspect value of `power` at each step
    }
    // Explanation:
    // 1. Initialize `power` to 3
    // 2. Continue loop as long as `power < 10000`
    // 3. Multiply `power` by 3 each time (power *= 3)
